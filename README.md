## Description
 
In this project, we utilized deep learning techniques to classify lung diseases with VGG16 and ResNet50 models. The ResNet50 model was trained for multiclass classification across five classes, while the VGG16 model was used for binary classification between two classes. Our experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of both models in lung disease categorization. Additionally, we deployed these models using Flask to create a web application for lung disease classification. This user-friendly tool allows medical practitioners to upload chest X-ray and CT scan images and receive instant predictions on the presence of lung disease.
Some of the lung diseases that can be detected are given below:
